== Installation ==

1. Download the plugin's zip file, extract the contents, and upload them to your wp-content/plugins folder.

3. Customise your settings by going to: Settings > Content Author Accessibility Preview.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Will this plugin make my site "fully accessible"? =

Absolutely not. There is no quick fix for accessibility, this plugin is to be used to highlight any potential accessibility issues to your content creators.

= Will this be visible to the public? =

No. By default, issues will only be highlighted to anyone who is logged in. You can also stop any particular user role from seeing the highlighting in the settings page. ( for example: if you have WooCommerce, you might want to deselect "Customers" from seeing the highlights ).
